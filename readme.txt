Unfortunately, I have run out of time, and will be unable to complete this coding
challenge.  I have a mostly functional front end and a functioning back end.
However, they are independent of each other, and therefore nonfunctional.

My intention was to use Kivy as the application framework.

A quick explanation of the files found within this directory:
  - bowlingGame.py
      A terminal version of the application, used to prove the backend handled
      the logic appropriately.

  - backend.py
      The start of the backend logic to be used by the application.

  - main.py
      The main application file.

  - bowling.kv
      The Kivy language file used to create the GUI.
